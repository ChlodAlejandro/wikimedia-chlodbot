<p>This is a collection of Tropical Cyclone Bulletins posted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAGASA" rel="nofollow">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA) while the system was inside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Area_of_Responsibility" rel="nofollow">Philippine Area of Responsibility</a> (PAR). System warnings are posted in 3-hour intervals at the peak of a system's activity in the PAR. Otherwise, the frequency depends on the storm's current impact on the country.</p>
<p>The PAGASA is responsible for raising tropical cyclone warnings for all tropical disturbances near the Philippines. The PAGASA also provides names for tropical cyclones which are separate from their international names.</p>
