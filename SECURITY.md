## Supported Versions

Only one version of Zoomiebot is actively supported: the version actively [deployed on Toolforge](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/zoomiebot/deployments/activity_log?environment=toolforge). The version on Toolforge is updated once a tag is pushed or a forcing commit is pushed onto the main branch. There are no plans to support Zoomiebot on other wikis, but you are free to fork Zoomiebot to fit in with your own wiki.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Zoomiebot is an open-source project with a single active developer, so reports of vulnerabilities are highly appreciated.

If you have found a vulnerability with Zoomiebot, please send an email immediately to `wiki@chlod.net` with a relevant subject line. Be sure to describe the specific steps used to replicate the vulnerability so that a fix can be created and deployed as soon as possible.

For vulnerabilities relating to packages that Zoomiebot depends on, please file an issue instead (unless this vulnerability can be exploited using Zoomiebot; in that case, follow the steps above). For vulnerabilities relating specifically to `@chlodalejandro/*` packages on npm, please send an email immediately to `chlod@chlod.net` with a relevant subject line. Describe the exact vulnerability and possibly a replication method for it.
